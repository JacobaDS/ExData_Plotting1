This is my submission for Course Project 1 of Exploratory Data Analysis.
My submission includes 4 PNG files and 4 R Scripts.

NOTE TO REVIEWERS: the R Scripts include code for READING the data (as prescribed by this Assignment).
In other words: the R Scripts assume that the following file is in your working directory:
household_power_consumption.txt

I did not include the code for downloading and unzipping the data, as this was not required.

Kind regards
